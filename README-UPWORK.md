# Code for RSVP

I want to use the code "081705". The following python code calculates the MD5 hash of the code.

```python
import hashlib
# String to be hashed
string_to_hash = "77777"
string_to_hash = "271117"
# Calculating the MD5 hash
print(hashlib.md5(string_to_hash.encode()).hexdigest())
```

It was working in the original code of the repo: "271117"
But I realized is not updated in the Google Script project.

# Google Script

I can share the Google Script project. I already add this code to 
https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbxWVTfgmn-gfdpCybL8RYQ9Bvz9CoU2eEnT0TZxoHhY_vaO_QAKGgYFu9hSrwsgV8Ll/exec

But I don't care about that project. I only want the RSVP to be saved in my Google Sheet, and to check that the code is working.

The code should be: "081705".

# Language

Add another version for Spanish. I will translate the text.

- detection of browser language
- add a button to change the language
- I don't care if the content is duplicated in the same file, or if it is in another file.

# Menu and design

- The image has blue sky on the left, and something harder to read on the right.
I don't care if the RSVP and Venue are on the right. My only issue is visibility.
